# Pipeline Creation Scenario Game

## OBJECTIVE

This exercise has 3 scenarios, each one is explained as if discussing with a person(s) at a company. From the scenario you should be able to identify toolchain components and place them in an order, effectively creating a pipeline.

Use [XebiaLabs Periodic table of DevOps](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/) to identify tools to create your Pipeline.

There are no wrong answers, only suggestions. If needed you can also add in tools that don’t exist, just be sure to explain why a tool was used.

## SKILLS

This has been designed to build confidence in your ability to identify tools a customer may mention. It’s structured in team fashion, where a technical person might identify a solution, a service focused person might catch team dynamics and business desires.

### SCENARIO 1 - COMPANY A

We’re a local government shop who uses public cloud and tools that have a strong supported background. Our web application services run on standard Windows Server virtual machines, however we have a stringent testing policy against the application that needs to happen on a regular basis. The application and operations teams store their co-existing solution in a single location so we can track/identify changes then move those changes into the systems as needed.

### SCENARIO 2 - COMPANY M

My team runs infrastructure. Though we share some tools with other departments, my team is looking for a solution to deploy and manage infrastructure tools at the native AWS object level. We place virtual instances into our environment and need to know: they will be there and their defined state. These instances are used to host our application containers and supporting infrastructure to access those. Once a solution is in place, gathering data from those tools is extremely important and must integrate with our existing systems.

### SCENARIO 3 - COMPANY Z

We are a new company and we are scaling at different rates. It’s been difficult to determine our sizing, and purchasing mechanisms are always seeming to slow us down. I’m looking for a solution that lets me start up and run very quickly, has scale and can be entered into a support contract when we reach size and we’re ready. We are a fully automated on-premises solution. What makes us unique is the customer user data we hold is all credential based, which we need to validate and test against. Also, ideally our solution would be container friendly as our teams are familiar with that technology and it will allow us to keep our technology portfolio down.
